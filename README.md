## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jkonan/jkonan.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

### BIOSKETCH
Joseph Konan is an Analytics Systems Programmer with the Telecom & Social Informatics Research Program and Pacific Health Informatics & Data Center at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UH TASI-PHIDC).  He implements and extends stochastic and machine learning methods for record linkage classification of individuals across various health data records (hospitals, insurers, and other EHR claims data) in order to facilitate health research.  His R package, ‘RecordLinkage_phidc,’ has become the standard for the Hawaiʻi Health Data Center under UH TASI-PHIDC for all payers claims data involving publicly insured individuals (i.e. Medicare, Medicaid, and State employees) for various insurance providers. Konan offers training on the use of the techniques and principles he uses in R for health policy researchers and practitioners in Hawaiʻi, Guam, and North Mariana.  Konan also advances independent applied econometric research involving large data sets on epidemiological, demographic, and economics of health care systems.  He will earn his B.S. degree from Santa Clara University as a triple major in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Sciences with a minor in Computer Engineering. As part of numerous capacity building initiatives, Konan has jointly and independently provided R training – in person and online via interactive labs and webinars – to government agencies and multilateral institutions in the Pacific region.
